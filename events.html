                IEEE GRIET SB Women In Engineering(WIE) AG, in collaboration with the Education Society of IEEE Hyderabad Section has organised a webinar on “Writing a winning Research Proposal” by Dr. M.G Sethuraman. The webinar was held using the online platform Cisco Webex Meetings. 
                The goal of a research proposal is to present and justify a research idea that one has and to present the practical ways                in which the research should be conducted. The webinar started off with Mr. M.G Sethuraman educating the attendees about            the purpose of a research proposal and the value they hold in building innovation to bring modern solutions to present              and future problems. He explained the significance of Research proposals and their effectiveness in transforming ideas              into reality. 
                Nextly, he introduced students to the statutory body:  Science and Education Research Board (SERB). This Government of              India establishment, aims to build up best management systems which would match the best global practices in the area of                promotion and funding of basic research. He detailed to the students about the various schemes offered by SERB that             support research funding and explained to students how to avail this opportunity. He also mentioned major fundamental           thrust schemes that are majorly funded for research. These include, basic science, Applied and interdisciplinary       sciences, humanities and social
