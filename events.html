              IEEE GRIET GRSS Student Chapter hosted an online quiz named
              “Quiztronics II” on 14th June 2021 from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM to
              provide students with an opportunity to test the grip a student
              possesses and to improvise their general knowledge in the field of
              electronics. The registrations of “Quiztronics II” were opened from
              11th June 2021 and around 55 participants enrolled themselves.
              It consisted of two rounds that covered the topics such as
              oscillators, transistors, diodes, semiconductors, etc. The preliminary
              round consisted of 10 Multiple choice questions, and the second
              round consisted of a crossword puzzle. There was a time limit of 20
              minutes per round to attempt the quiz. All the questions asked were
              designed to brush up on the participants’ prerequisite learnings of
              electronics.
              Students from various departments attempted the quiz to understand
              their command over the given subject. The contestants
              enthusiastically participated and showcased their brilliance by
              rapidly answering the questions asked.
              The winners were given merit certificates for their outstanding
              insight. The quiz enabled the students to identify what they know
              and what they don’t. We hope that the participants now have a
              better idea of how well they can grasp the topics that are being
              taught, hopefully motivating them to study more.
